NeandertalBoneMetagenome
========================

Storage for files and scripts for the Neandertal bone metagenome project.

ContigsHtml
========================

tgz: ContigsHtml_v1.tgz

start at: ContigsList.html 

assemblies: [LS]SU*end0.html

susbtitutions: [LS]SU*end5.rm5.html

Description:
These files were generated to inspect the assembly results. The script generating the html page marked in black all positions that disagree with the consensus (end0). To inspect the subsitution calculations, the script marks the positions in black, but applying certain cleaning procedure. That is ignore the ends until 5 consecutive bp agree with the consensus (potential adaptor leftovers) and ignore reads that have overall more that 5 subsitutions (occasional polymorphic or misassembled read). 

Alignments
========================

Description:
These alignment blocks were used for phylogenies, with the purpose of inspecting whether sediment clones (PCR amplified with bacterial universal primers 27f and 1492r, as well as actinobacterial primers) will place as sister groups to any of the bone consensus sequences. In case you wonder: they dont.
